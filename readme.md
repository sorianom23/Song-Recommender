# **üéµ Song Recommender üéµ**

**Date: April 2022**


## Description
This is a simulation of a business case where I have to improve the company's song recommendation sistem.
In order to accomplish the goal I will be using DBSCAN clustering, a density-based clustering method.

The final product will take a song as an input from the user and will output another song (the recommendation).

## Technologies used
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
- [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/)

## Final product
You can try the song recommender here üëâüèº https://song-recommendations.herokuapp.com/

## Roadmap
- [x] Webscrapping data for the hot and not hot songs.
- [x] Make the necessary connections for the Spotify API.
- [x] Apply k-means method for clustering. (First attempt)
- [x] Apply DBSCAN method for clustering. (Worked better)
- [x] Create front end with Streamlit.


## Datasets
The data was obtained webscrapping the following websites:
- For the Billboard top 100: https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100
